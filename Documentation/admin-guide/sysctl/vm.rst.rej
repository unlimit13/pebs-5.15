+demote_scale_factor
+===================
+
+This factor controls when kswapd wakes up to demote pages from toptier
+nodes. It defines the amount of memory left in a toptier node/system
+before kswapd is woken up and how much memory needs to be free from those
+nodes before kswapd goes back to sleep.
+
+The unit is in fractions of 10,000. The default value of 200 means if there
+are less than 2% of free toptier memory in a node/system, we will start  to
+demote pages from that node.
